# THE BIFID CIHPER

## HISTORY

The bifid cipher was invented in 1895 by Felix-Marie Delastelle, a French cryptographer.
Delastelle was born in 1840 and died at 64 years old in 1902
Other notable accomplishments of Delastelle are inventing the trifid cipher and four-square cipher.

The bifid cipher was first published in a French journal named "Revue de Genie Civil" which translates to the "Journal of Civil Engineering".
Delastelle also wrote a book in cryptography shortly before his death in 1901.

The bifid cipher uses a transposed Polybius square and fractionation to encrypt messages.
